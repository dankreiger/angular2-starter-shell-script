All is well if there are no console messages starting with npm ERR! at the end of npm install. There might be a few npm WARN messages along the way â€” and that is perfectly fine.\n\n
We often see an npm WARN message after a series of gyp ERR! messages. Ignore them. A package may try to recompile itself using node-gyp. If the recompile fails, the package recovers (typically with a pre-built version) and everything works.\n\n
Just make sure there are no npm ERR! messages at the end of npm install.")
