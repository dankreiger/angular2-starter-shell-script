*   Check your Node version in your terminal/console:

<pre>node -v</pre>

3.  Make sure you have npm version 3.0.0 or higher installed:

*   Check your npm version in your terminal/console:

<pre>npm -v</pre>

You can download [Node and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/), and it's also helpful to have [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) for node version management.

More specific details are available at the Angular 2 [official docs](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html) or its corresponding [GitHub README](https://github.com/angular/quickstart/blob/master/README.md) documentation.
